   - Added `'use client'` directive (required for onClick handlers)
   - Added wishlist heart button
   - Replaced quick view with quick add-to-cart
   - Enhanced stock status logic (3 states)
   - Improved hover effects and transitions

2. **`src/app/products/page.tsx`**
   - Added trust badges grid section
   - Added breadcrumb navigation

3. **`src/components/layout/header.tsx`** (from earlier work)

### Bug Fixes:

**Error**: "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props"

- **Fix**: Added `'use client'` directive to product-card.tsx
- **Result**: All interactive features now working correctly
