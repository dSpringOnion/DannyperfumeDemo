## üìã When to Read Which Documentation

### Before Planning New Features
1. **Read this README first** to understand available docs
2. **Read relevant task docs** for similar implementations
3. **Read system docs** for architecture context
4. **Read relevant SOPs** for standard processes

### Before Implementation
1. **Review the specific task/PRD** you're implementing
2. **Check system architecture** for integration points
3. **Follow SOPs** for standard procedures (DB migrations, API endpoints, etc.)

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update Docs

1. **After implementing features** - Update task docs with actual implementation
2. **After fixing bugs** - Create SOP to prevent same mistakes
3. **After making architectural changes** - Update system docs
4. **When establishing new processes** - Create new SOPs

### How to Update

Use the `/update-doc` command to automatically:
- Generate new SOPs
- Update system architecture docs
- Maintain this README index
- Keep docs in sync with codebase
